# PangetToPogiJson
this java program prettifies a json.
because when opening an json output from a curl command returns a one liner json file.

## Requirement
1. Java Jdk/JRE 8.
+ tested only in java 8.
+ please test in other versions.
2. Java is in the path.
3. be able to get version of java.
+ to make sure java is in the path.

## Easy run

download the [jar file with dependencies](PangetToPogiJson-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar) from the target folder

then run it via java -jar.

```
java -jar PangetToPogiJson-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
this will create a panget folder then put an ugly json inside the folder and the program will automatically create a pogi folder with the pretty json inside.

## other information
+ i use apache camel for this.
+ i created a bat file to run the jar, and will try to commit it in the future. :P
+ **PANGET** in _Filipino_ means *UGLY* and **POGI** in _Filipino_ means *HANDSOME*.
